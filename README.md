# Welcome!

Hi, I'm [Ben Aitcheson](https://www.benaitcheson.me), and I'm currently learning Full-Stack Web Development through Coder Academy in Brisbane, Australia. I have a background in finance with a short period of contract law. I enjoy learning all things web development and wish to start building things to help automate all things finance related.

I currently help run a Brisbane freeCodeCamp meetup which you can join [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/980100678716424). We run our meetups fortnightly.

Languages from my course are:
Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React, Node, Postgresql.

Here are some socials, should you wish to get in contact with me:
